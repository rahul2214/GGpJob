## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Blue (#4285F4), conveying trust, stability, and professionalism, important for job searching. 
- Background color: Light gray (#F5F5F5), creating a clean, uncluttered, and accessible layout.
- Accent color: Green (#34A853), to highlight calls to action (CTAs) and positive actions or information (e.g. "Application Sent!")
- Font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font for both headings and body text, to give a modern, neutral, readable feel.
- Use clear and professional icons from a consistent set (e.g., Material Design Icons) to represent job categories, locations, and application statuses.
- Maintain a clean and organized layout with consistent spacing and alignment to ensure readability and ease of navigation.  Use card-based designs for job listings to display information concisely.
- Incorporate subtle animations and transitions to enhance user experience (e.g., loading animations, smooth scrolling, and feedback animations on button presses).
